# **System Architecture Overview**

The platform comprises several core components working together to provide a secure, multi-language FaaS solution. **Figure 1** illustrates a typical FaaS architecture, where developers upload function code, configure triggers (like API calls), and the cloud platform executes the code on demand. Key components include:

- **API Gateway** – The public entry point that authenticates and receives function submission and invocation requests (e.g. HTTP calls or events). It routes requests to the appropriate internal services and collects metrics for monitoring ([Serverless Open-Source Frameworks: OpenFaaS, Knative, & more | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/04/13/serverless-open-source-frameworks-openfaas-knative-more/#:~:text=)). It may also handle multi-tenant concerns like rate limiting and authentication tokens.
- **Orchestration Layer (Controller/Scheduler)** – A central brain that coordinates function deployment and execution. When code is submitted, the orchestrator prepares an execution environment (container or micro-VM) on a worker node, schedules the function run, and keeps track of running instances ([Apache OpenWhisk architecture | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apache-OpenWhisk-architecture_fig1_370778480#:~:text=,requests%20appropriately%20to%20the)). It manages a queue of execution requests and distributes them across available workers for load balancing.
- **Execution Environment (Workers)** – A pool of workers (on one or multiple nodes) that actually run the functions inside isolated sandboxes. Each worker runs Docker containers (or lightweight VMs) for each function invocation, ensuring the code runs with the specified runtime (Node.js for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, etc.) in isolation ([Apache OpenWhisk architecture | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apache-OpenWhisk-architecture_fig1_370778480#:~:text=,requests%20appropriately%20to%20the)). Workers report back results and status to the orchestrator.
- **Dependency Cache/Registry** – A service or storage system that caches function packages and dependencies. When a function is deployed, its required libraries (npm packages, pip modules, crates, etc.) are resolved and stored so that subsequent invocations or deployments can reuse them without re-downloading. This drastically reduces cold start times by avoiding redundant fetches.
- **Monitoring & Logging** – A subsystem for collecting metrics (invocation counts, durations, resource usage) and logs from function executions. For example, the API Gateway and workers emit metrics to a Prometheus-based monitoring service ([Serverless Open-Source Frameworks: OpenFaaS, Knative, & more | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/04/13/serverless-open-source-frameworks-openfaas-knative-more/#:~:text=)). Logs from each function container can be streamed to a centralized logging service for debugging and audit.

**Data Flow – From Submission to Execution:** When a developer submits a function (via an HTTP API or CLI), the code package and its metadata (language, dependencies, resource limits, etc.) are sent to the API Gateway. The Gateway forwards this to the Orchestration Layer, which registers the new function and parses its dependencies (see **Dependency Resolution** below). The orchestrator then either **builds** a new container image for the function or fetches a prepared sandbox, and schedules the function to run on a worker node. On invocation, an incoming request/event is received by the Gateway and routed to the orchestrator, which identifies the target function and finds an idle instance or instructs a worker to launch a new one. The event data is passed into the function's container through a secure channel (e.g., HTTP POST to a local endpoint or an in-memory invocation API). The function code executes and produces a result, which is sent back from the worker to the orchestrator and ultimately to the API Gateway, which returns the response to the client ([Blueprint of a serverless platform architecture. FaaS: Function as a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Blueprint-of-a-serverless-platform-architecture-FaaS-Function-as-a-Service-API_fig6_338548862#:~:text=,)). During this flow, the platform also captures logs and metrics – for instance, the function's stdout/stderr and execution time are streamed to the monitoring service before the container is terminated (if it was a one-off execution).

**Request Management & Distribution:** The Orchestration Layer maintains a queue of invocation requests (backed by an internal broker like Kafka or NATS for reliability in a distributed setup). When functions are invoked rapidly, the orchestrator may scale out multiple container instances across different worker nodes to handle load, distributing requests to avoid hot-spots ([Apache OpenWhisk architecture | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apache-OpenWhisk-architecture_fig1_370778480#:~:text=,requests%20appropriately%20to%20the)). A simple scheduling policy might be round-robin or least-loaded selection of workers. For high throughput, the orchestrator keeps a small pool of warm containers ready – if a request arrives and a compatible warm container is idle, it is reused to skip container startup. Otherwise, a new container is launched on a chosen worker. The orchestrator ensures that each worker's capacity (CPU, memory) is respected using a load-aware scheduler. For instance, if one node is busy, the next invocation will be sent to another node with more headroom. This distribution mechanism prevents any single node from becoming a bottleneck and enables horizontal scaling of the FaaS platform on multiple TDX-enabled nodes.

# **Execution Sandboxing in TDX**

([Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html#:~:text=Intel%20TDX%20uses%20hardware%20extensions,SEAM%20mode))To maximize security, every function runs inside a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)** backed by Intel TDX. Intel TDX creates hardware-isolated VMs (known as trust domains) where memory is encrypted and cannot be accessed by the host OS or hypervisor ([Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html#:~:text=Intel%20TDX%20uses%20hardware%20extensions,SEAM%20mode)). In our platform, each function's execution environment is a lightweight virtual machine _protected by TDX_ – this means that even if the host is compromised, the code and data inside the function's VM remain confidential and integer. The worker nodes launch each function invocation inside a TDX enclave, providing a root-of-trust that the code will run with confidentiality and integrity guaranteed by hardware. Before use, the enclave can perform remote attestation (proving to the orchestrator or client that it's running on genuine TDX hardware with the expected code) – this attestation confirms that the software stack inside the enclave is as expected and the enclave is secure ([Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html#:~:text=Attestation%20confirms%20that%20hardware%20and,that%20the%20server%20is%20trustworthy)).

([Confidential Containers Made Easy](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/confidential-containers-made-easy.html#:~:text=Kata%20Containers%20work%20just%20like,trusted%20infrastructure)) ([Confidential Containers Made Easy](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/confidential-containers-made-easy.html#:~:text=In%20a%20Confidential%20Container%2C%20TEEs,service%20before%20running%20a%20workload))Beyond TDX's memory encryption, the platform enforces _layered sandboxing_. Each function instance is encapsulated in a Docker container running inside the TDX-protected VM. This approach, often called "Confidential Containers", combines VM-level isolation with container security ([Confidential Containers Made Easy](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/confidential-containers-made-easy.html#:~:text=Kata%20Containers%20work%20just%20like,trusted%20infrastructure)). As shown in **Figure 2**, the Kata Containers project follows a similar design: containers run inside a lightweight KVM-based VM, and with TDX the guest VM's memory is encrypted (denoted as the TEE) ([Confidential Containers Made Easy](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/confidential-containers-made-easy.html#:~:text=In%20Kata%20Containers%2C%20container%20images,via%20a%20shared%20FX%20solution)). In our platform, when the orchestrator schedules a function, a lightweight hypervisor (like **Firecracker** or QEMU with TDX support) launches a micro-VM that contains the function's container. The micro-VM provides an additional virtualization boundary, and TDX ensures the VM's memory is encrypted and isolated from the host. Within the VM, a minimal guest OS hosts the Docker engine (or an agent) that runs the function container. This **nested isolation** means an attacker would need to break out of the function container _and_ the micro-VM/TEE – an extremely difficult feat.

We use Docker's default seccomp profile (secure computing mode) to filter system calls – by default Docker uses an allowlist, permitting common syscalls and blocking disallowed ones ([Incoming system calls should be filtered using enabled Seccomp profiles
](https://docs.datadoghq.com/security/default_rules/cis-docker-1.2.0-5.21/#:~:text=Seccomp%20filtering%20provides%20a%20means,with%20your%20container%20application%20usage)). This limits the kernel attack surface available to the function code. Additionally, we drop **Linux capabilities** that are not needed by the function. Each container runs as a non-root user to prevent privilege escalation (the container's root is mapped to an unprivileged host user) ([Defending Against Container Breakout: Strategies for a Secure Container Ecosystem | by Ramkrushna Maheshwar | Medium](https://medium.com/@maheshwar.ramkrushna/defending-against-container-breakout-strategies-for-a-secure-container-ecosystem-7612b1ae46be#:~:text=2)). Only a minimal set of capabilities (e.g., network access for outgoing requests, if allowed) are granted; everything else (mounting filesystems, altering kernel parameters, etc.) is disabled. Combined with seccomp (which intercepts and forbids dangerous syscalls) and an AppArmor/SELinux profile (restricting file system access), the container is heavily sandboxed even within its VM.

Other isolation layers used include **cgroups** and **namespaces**. Cgroups constrain CPU and memory usage per function, ensuring one function cannot starve others or the host – e.g., a malicious or buggy function in a tight loop will be throttled to its assigned CPU quota. Namespaces (PID, network, mount, etc.) ensure the function's process sees only its own processes and filesystem, not the host's. The guest kernel inside the TDX VM is a minimal kernel with only necessary drivers, reducing the attack surface further ([Serverless Open-Source Frameworks: OpenFaaS, Knative, & more | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/04/13/serverless-open-source-frameworks-openfaas-knative-more/#:~:text=Firecracker%C2%A0is%20a%20virtualization%20technology%20introduced,modified%20Linux%20kernel%20is%20launched)).

We also integrate **gVisor** as an optional additional layer for certain workloads. gVisor is a user-space kernel developed by Google that intercepts application system calls and implements them in a safe, isolated manner ([

Running a function container under gVisor (in addition to TDX) means that even syscalls are emulated by a user-space monitor (the "sentry"), preventing potentially malicious syscalls from ever reaching the real kernel ([

While gVisor adds some overhead, it can be used for untrusted code requiring an extra level of syscall filtering beyond Docker's default seccomp.

**Firecracker MicroVMs:** Our platform leverages Firecracker (the AWS-created VMM) to launch microVMs for functions. Firecracker is purpose-built for FaaS isolation – it's a lightweight VMM written in Rust that can launch VMs in ~125ms with a very small memory footprint ([

Each Firecracker microVM runs a stripped-down Linux kernel with just enough to execute the function container, eliminating unnecessary devices and services ([Serverless Open-Source Frameworks: OpenFaaS, Knative, & more | CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/04/13/serverless-open-source-frameworks-openfaas-knative-more/#:~:text=Firecracker%C2%A0is%20a%20virtualization%20technology%20introduced,modified%20Linux%20kernel%20is%20launched)). We chose Firecracker for its combination of speed and isolation: it provides the security of a VM (separate kernel, strong isolation) with near-container startup times. This is crucial when combined with TDX, as we want minimal overhead on each invocation. The microVM is configured via a jailer process to have limited access to host resources (like a tap device for networking if needed), and it runs under KVM with TDX so its memory is encrypted by hardware. In effect, the isolation stack for each function is: **[Hardware TDX] -> [Firecracker microVM] -> [Docker container] -> Function code**. This multi-layer sandboxing follows _defense in depth_: even if one layer is compromised, the next layer still protects the system.

**Best Practices for Security vs. Performance:** We carefully balance security and performance. Some of the practices include: using minimal base images (e.g., Alpine or Distroless images) for function containers to reduce the attack surface and speed up loading ([Defending Against Container Breakout: Strategies for a Secure Container Ecosystem | by Ramkrushna Maheshwar | Medium](https://medium.com/@maheshwar.ramkrushna/defending-against-container-breakout-strategies-for-a-secure-container-ecosystem-7612b1ae46be#:~:text=,to%20limit%20the%20attack%20surface)); keeping the TCB (trusted computing base) of the guest OS small (perhaps using a specialized minimal Linux or even library OS). We enable TDX's features like Secure EPT and assist in mitigating side-channels by pinning each enclave VM to dedicated CPU cores when possible (to avoid leaking data via shared caches). Hyper-threading can be disabled for cores running enclaves, so that no two different enclaves share an execution thread and microarchitectural state. Additionally, we plan for **performance tuning** such as using hugepages for enclave memory (to reduce TLB misses) and dedicating a portion of memory for the enclaves to avoid frequent exits. In cases where absolute performance is needed for less sensitive code, the orchestrator could launch a container _without_ TDX (for internal trusted functions) or use a pool of warm microVMs. However, for user-submitted code we default to the maximum isolation at the slight cost of increased startup time. Thanks to Firecracker and caching (as discussed later), cold start times are kept within an acceptable range while still maintaining strong security.

# **Dependency Resolution & Optimization**

When a user submits code, the platform automatically detects and fetches the dependencies required by the function. This **dependency resolution** is language-specific:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js)** – The submission can include a `package.json` (and possibly a lock file like `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`). The orchestration layer will parse this to identify NPM packages needed. If TypeScript is used, a build step transpiles the TypeScript to JavaScript (using `tsc`) as part of the deployment. We optimize this by caching the TypeScript compiler docker layer so it doesn't reinstall `typescript` every time. After code submission, the platform runs `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in an isolated build environment to fetch all required packages. These packages are stored in a **dependency cache**. Instead of fetching from the internet on every deployment, the platform first checks an internal cache: for example, if version 4.17.1 of `express` was fetched previously, it's pulled from the local cache. We maintain a shared read-only volume of common Node.js modules, or even bake frequently used packages into the base image. This way, deploying a Node function with common libraries can be nearly instant because the dependencies are already present on the host or image.

- **Python** – Similar approach: the user may provide a `requirements.txt` or Pipfile listing needed Python packages. The system reads this and uses `pip` (or pipenv/poetry as needed) to install dependencies into a virtual environment or directly into the function's container image. We use a **layered Docker image** strategy: a base Python runtime image (with common packages) is layered with a snapshot of the installed requirements. If two functions have identical requirements, we reuse the same dependency layer. The dependency cache for Python might be a wheel cache – the platform keeps a cache of Python wheel files (.whl) for libraries. For example, if `pandas==1.5.0` was installed previously, the cached wheel is used rather than re-download. This cuts down cold start overhead significantly.

- **Go** – For Go functions, which are compiled, the "dependencies" are Go modules. A user might submit a Go module with a `go.mod` file. The platform will run `go mod download` to fetch all required modules. These are cached in a Go module cache directory (usually `$GOPATH/pkg/mod`) that is persisted across builds. The function is then compiled to a static binary (using `go build`) inside the TDX enclave or a secure build container. We optimize by using incremental builds: if the `go.mod` and `go.sum` haven't changed from a previous submission, we reuse the compiled modules from cache. The compilation output (the binary) is then packaged into a minimal container (FROM scratch or distroless base). Go's compilation can be relatively fast, but for large projects caching the modules and object files speeds it up. We could also allow users to upload a pre-compiled binary to skip this step (with attestation to ensure it's not malicious).

- **Rust** – Rust functions are handled by compiling the Rust project (detected via `Cargo.toml`). The orchestrator examines `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` to determine the crate dependencies. We leverage Rust's cargo build cache: we have a shared cargo registry and target directory cache in the build environment. For instance, if two functions both use `serde v1.0`, the first build will compile it, and subsequent builds reuse the compiled artifact from cache. We may use tools like `cargo chef` to pre-build dependency layers: one step computes a recipe of all dependencies, and another builds them, producing a Docker image layer with all crates compiled. Then the actual function code is compiled linking against those cached crates, resulting in much faster builds for cold deployments. The Rust code is then compiled to a binary (with optimizations for release mode if appropriate) and packaged. Because Rust binaries can be large, we upx-compress or strip symbols for smaller size, and optionally use musl to get static binaries. The end result is placed in a container or even run directly in a Firecracker VM (Rust binaries don't need an OS if statically linked).

**Caching Strategies to Minimize Cold Starts:** Cold start refers to the first time a function is invoked and the platform has to set up the environment from scratch (downloading deps, creating container, etc.). We implement aggressive caching at multiple levels to minimize this latency:

- _Dependency Cache_: As described, any artifact that can be reused is cached. We maintain an **internal package repository mirror** for npm, PyPI, Cargo, etc., so that fetching packages is a local network operation (fast and not dependent on external internet). For example, once a package is downloaded the first time, it's stored locally for future use. We also cache OS-level packages and language runtimes. The base Docker images for each language (Node.js, Python, etc.) are pre-pulled on all worker nodes so that starting a container doesn't spend time pulling the image from a registry. This means a new container can start in seconds because the image layers are already on disk.

- _Layered Container Images_: Our build system uses Docker layering to our advantage. When building a function's container image, we separate the steps of installing dependencies from adding the function code. For instance, for a Node function, we might have a Dockerfile that does `COPY package.json .` -> `RUN npm install` -> `COPY app code .`. Docker will cache the layer after `npm install` keyed by the exact contents of `package.json`. So if another function comes with an identical `package.json`, the npm install layer can be pulled from cache instantly ([[2409.09202] WarmSwap: Sharing Dependencies for Accelerating Cold Starts in Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09202#:~:text=initialize%20middleware%20or%20software%20dependencies,of%20optimization%20space%20when)). This effectively allows sharing common dependencies across different functions. In practice, we implement a content-addressable cache of dependency layers: e.g., a hash of the requirements file maps to a stored Docker layer tarball. On deployment, if that hash is found, we skip installing and just reuse the layer.

- _Pre-Built Runtimes_: For very common combinations of dependencies (e.g., AWS SDKs, common web frameworks), we maintain "layered base images." For example, a Node.js image with Express pre-installed, or a Python image with SciPy stack pre-installed. When a function's requirements match one of these profiles, we use the pre-built image as the base, avoiding a full install. This turns cold starts into warm starts for many use cases.

- _WarmSwap and Snapshotting_: In research, techniques like **WarmSwap** propose snapshotting a container after it has loaded its dependencies, and then cloning that snapshot for new instances ([[2409.09202] WarmSwap: Sharing Dependencies for Accelerating Cold Starts in Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09202#:~:text=initialize%20middleware%20or%20software%20dependencies,of%20optimization%20space%20when)). Our platform can employ a similar idea: keep an idle container running with all dependencies loaded (for example, a JVM started or a Node VM with required modules loaded into memory), and when a new instance is needed, fork or snapshot that state to serve the request without rerunning initialization. This is easier with microVMs – we can start a microVM, load the function's code and dependencies, then snapshot the VM's memory. Future cold invokes can boot from this snapshot (memory image), saving the overhead of loading the runtime and libraries. This idea, inspired by AWS Lambda's SnapStart and research like WarmSwap ([[2409.09202] WarmSwap: Sharing Dependencies for Accelerating Cold Starts in Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09202#:~:text=initialize%20middleware%20or%20software%20dependencies,of%20optimization%20space%20when)) ([[2409.09202] WarmSwap: Sharing Dependencies for Accelerating Cold Starts in Serverless Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09202#:~:text=function%20instance,image%20among%20ten%20different%20functions)), can reduce cold start times by 2-3x by eliminating repeated init of heavy libraries.

**Language-specific Optimizations:** Different runtime languages require tailored optimization:

- _Node.js/TS_: V8 engine will JIT-compile hot functions. We try to keep containers alive for a few invocations so that the V8 JIT has time to optimize the hot code paths, yielding faster subsequent runs. If a function is invoked frequently, the instance stays warm and benefits from V8's optimizations. We also use Node.js's built-in module caching: requiring a module is done once per container, so subsequent invocations in the same container don't reload the module from disk. This encourages keeping containers alive for multiple requests when possible (within a timeout).
- _Python_: We avoid cold-start overhead by pre-importing commonly used modules in the container image. Python's import can be slow for large packages (like numpy), so by having them already imported in a warm container, a function invocation doesn't pay that cost. We also consider using alternative runtimes or versions (e.g., PyPy) for long-lived execution to improve performance, but CPython with caching is typically sufficient for short tasks. Furthermore, for CPU-intensive Python code, users can provide a precompiled C extension or we can JIT compile via PyPy or Numba at runtime and cache the compiled artifact.
- _Go & Rust_: These produce native binaries which start very quickly (no interpreter). The main optimization is reducing binary size and ensuring any one-time initialization in `main()` is minimal. We encourage users to do lazy initialization if possible. Also, since Go and Rust have no VM warm-up, a single invocation per container is fine – we don't need to keep them running as long to "warm up" the runtime (though caching DNS or other handles can help).
- _TypeScript_: The transpilation step is done at deploy time so it doesn't affect invocation latency. We generate source maps and keep them outside the runtime to reduce package size. By doing ahead-of-time transpile and bundling (using webpack or esbuild to bundle Node modules into one file), we reduce the number of file system accesses needed at startup, which improves cold start.
- _Language Sandboxing_: For each runtime, we strip out optional features that could slow startup. For instance, we might start V8 isolate with no inspector and no debug support for production runs to save overhead. For Python, we run with `-OO` (optimized mode) to skip docstring loading. These micro-optimizations accumulate to shave off milliseconds wherever possible.

In summary, by intelligently parsing user code for dependencies and leveraging caching on every layer (network, filesystem, image, memory), the system ensures that the heavy lifting of dependency resolution is done only once. Subsequent function invocations – even for first-time runs – find a ready environment where most components are already in place, drastically reducing latency attributable to dependency loading.

# **Container Orchestration & Job Scheduling**

The platform employs a distributed orchestration mechanism to manage function execution across a cluster of worker nodes. The orchestrator's job scheduler ensures each function invocation is placed on an appropriate worker, new function containers are spun up efficiently, and resources are utilized optimally.

**Task Distribution Across Workers:** We have a cluster of worker nodes (which may themselves run inside TDX-protected VMs on physical hosts). The orchestrator maintains a registry of available workers and their capacities (free memory, CPU, etc.). When an invocation request comes in, the scheduler picks a worker for it. A simple strategy is load balancing – e.g., maintain a round-robin rotation or track the number of active containers on each worker and pick the least loaded. More advanced strategies incorporate function affinity: if a worker already has a warm container for that function (from a previous invocation), the scheduler will prefer sending the request there to reuse the warm container (to avoid a cold start) ([Blueprint of a serverless platform architecture. FaaS: Function as a... | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Blueprint-of-a-serverless-platform-architecture-FaaS-Function-as-a-Service-API_fig6_338548862#:~:text=,)). If no warm container exists, it picks a worker with enough capacity and perhaps low latency (for example, if functions are tied to certain data, choose a worker near that data for performance).

Once a worker is selected, the orchestrator dispatches the job to that worker. There are a couple of ways this is implemented:

- **Message Queue**: The orchestrator could publish a message to a queue (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) that the target worker is subscribed to ([Apache OpenWhisk architecture | Download Scientific Diagram](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Apache-OpenWhisk-architecture_fig1_370778480#:~:text=,requests%20appropriately%20to%20the)). The message contains the function ID, invocation data, and any other metadata needed. The worker's agent receives the message and proceeds to handle the execution.
- **Direct RPC**: Alternatively, the orchestrator could call a worker's internal API (for example, an HTTP or gRPC call to the worker's agent) to tell it to run the function. This is simpler but a queue provides more decoupling and buffering.

Each worker runs a **Worker Agent** process (written in Rust as well) which listens for tasks. When it receives a task, it checks if the function’s container image is already present and up-to-date. If not, it pulls or builds the image (from the dependency cache or registry). Then it spawns the container (or Firecracker microVM) to execute the function. The agent manages the lifecycle: it can keep the container running idle for a configurable time after the execution to anticipate another request (keeping it warm), or terminate it immediately if the policy is single-run-per-container.

**Load Balancing and Scaling:** The orchestrator monitors the system load and can scale horizontally. If a particular function experiences a spike in traffic, the orchestrator will spawn multiple containers, possibly on multiple nodes, to handle concurrent executions. It respects concurrency limits per function (if configured) to avoid overwhelming services the function might call. The scheduling algorithm tries to pack containers in a way that efficient use of resources is achieved (similar to bin-packing). For example, one worker might run 10 Node.js function instances each using 128MB, while another runs a couple of heavier Python ones using 1GB each. The orchestrator knows each worker’s total capacity (say 8 GB RAM, 4 vCPUs) and ensures not to exceed it – this is aided by cgroups enforcement on workers. If the cluster is nearing saturation (all workers fully utilized), the platform can autoscale by provisioning a new worker node (in Docker Compose this might mean spinning up another container acting as a worker, or if on Kubernetes, scaling the deployment). The design allows adding more workers easily since the orchestrator is stateless (or uses distributed state storage) and can coordinate an elastic number of workers.

**Minimizing Startup Overhead:** We implement several tactics to reduce per-invocation startup overhead:

- **Container Reuse (Warm Containers)**: After a function container finishes handling a request, instead of tearing it down immediately, the worker can leave it running (idle) for a short period (e.g., 5-10 minutes) to serve subsequent requests quickly. This avoids repeated cold starts. The orchestrator will route subsequent invocations of that function to the same node to hit the warm container. If the container stays idle beyond the timeout, the agent will gracefully shut it down to free resources.
- **Provisioned Concurrency**: For functions that are known to be latency-sensitive or high-traffic, the user (or platform by policy) can request a certain number of instances to always be kept running. This is akin to AWS Lambda’s provisioned concurrency. The scheduler will pro-actively start N instances of the function across the cluster and keep them running, so that when requests arrive, they are handled with zero cold start. This naturally uses more resources, so it’s opt-in per function or auto-adjusted based on observed traffic.
- **Batching and Queueing**: If a function is invoked extremely frequently, rather than starting hundreds of containers at once (thrashing the system), the orchestrator might queue some invocations and reuse a smaller pool of containers to handle them sequentially or in small batches. This provides backpressure to the calling clients in a controlled way and prevents a stampede of cold starts. The queue ensures reliability – if a worker goes down while a request is queued, another worker can pick it up from the queue.

**Efficient Docker Image Management:** Building and deploying container images for each function could be slow if done naively. We optimize this by:

- Performing builds on a **dedicated build service** (possibly on the orchestrator or separate builder nodes) so that worker nodes focus on running functions rather than building images. The build service uses BuildKit to build images in parallel and uses the caching techniques described earlier.
- Storing built images in a local Docker registry (which could simply be the orchestrator acting as a registry, or a lightweight registry container). Workers pull images from this registry over the LAN, which is fast. Because images are content-addressable, if the same layers already exist on a worker, the pull is almost instant (it sees the layer via its hash and skips downloading).
- Using image layer caching on workers: we keep the layers of recently used images on disk. For example, if two functions share the Python base layer, it’s stored once and reused. We avoid `docker system prune` on workers for frequently used layers to persist the benefit.
- **Lazy Loading**: With TDX and confidential containers, we consider lazy-loading container root file systems. The idea is that instead of pulling an entire image before startup, we can start a container and fetch needed layers on-demand (over the network) as the function code tries to access files. This can reduce time-to-first-execution if the image is large but the function only uses part of it initially. Techniques like Kubernetes’ lazy loading of container images (e.g., using Stargz or CRFS) could be applied.

**Orchestration with Docker Compose:** Since the deployment is done via Docker Compose, each core component (gateway, orchestrator, monitoring, etc.) runs as a Docker service. The worker agents themselves might be containerized (each agent container might spawn sibling Docker containers for functions – essentially Docker-in-Docker or using the host’s Docker socket). In a single-node setup, Docker Compose can launch one orchestrator container and multiple worker agent containers, simulating a cluster. The orchestrator knows about each agent (their service names or a simple service registry). For multi-node, one could use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for actual distribution, but Compose is sufficient for a smaller scale or development environment. The design ensures that adding a new agent container (in Compose or Swarm) is picked up by the orchestrator (either through static config or a discovery mechanism).

**Resource Efficiency:** The system tries to maximize resource utilization without compromising isolation. Idle containers are culled, and busy containers are packed onto nodes carefully. If two lightweight functions can reside on one core by time-sharing, the scheduler will colocate them. We also take advantage of Linux kernel features to make launching containers faster and leaner: for instance, using copy-on-write filesystems for containers so that multiple containers can share read-only layers in memory. Where possible, we might use a pooled filesystem like Aufs or overlayfs so that starting a container doesn’t duplicate the whole file system. This is particularly effective when many instances of the same function run – they share the same image layers in memory.

The result of these orchestration strategies is a system where function execution tasks are quickly dispatched to where they can run fastest, with minimal queuing and minimal overhead. The orchestrator ensures fairness and efficiency cluster-wide, so that one heavy workload doesn’t slow down others, and that the addition of more nodes linearly increases the capacity of the system. This scalable design allows the FaaS platform to handle from a handful to thousands of concurrent function executions securely and reliably.

# **API Design & Implementation in Rust**

The platform exposes a RESTful API (and corresponding CLI) for users to manage and invoke serverless functions. The API is implemented in Rust (e.g., using an async web framework like **Actix-web** or **Warp** for high performance). Below is an overview of the REST API endpoints:

- **POST `/functions`** – _Submit a new function_. The client provides the function code package (e.g., as a JSON with code inline, or a multipart upload of a zip file) along with metadata like language, maybe a unique function name, memory limit, timeout, etc. The server responds with a unique Function ID (or name) and the status of deployment. For example, a request might include a JSON body with fields: `{ "language": "python", "source": "<base64-encoded code or link>", "requirements.txt": "pandas==1.5.0\nnumpy==1.21.0" }`. The orchestrator immediately parses and begins building the function’s container image asynchronously.

- **GET `/functions/{id}`** – _Get function metadata_. Returns details about the function (language, size, last deployment time, etc.) and possibly its current status (e.g., whether the container image build is complete and the function is ready to invoke). The status could be `"deploying"`, `"ready"`, or `"error"` (with error details if build failed).

- **GET `/functions/{id}/status`** – _Check deployment or last run status_. This could overlap with the above, but might specifically report on whether the function image is built and how many instances are active, etc. In an async deployment model, the user might poll this endpoint until the function is ready.

- **POST `/functions/{id}/invoke`** – _Invoke the function synchronously_. The request body contains the input data for the function (could be JSON or binary, depending on function API). The platform will route this request through the orchestrator to a worker, execute the function, and wait for the result. The HTTP response will contain the function’s output (for example, JSON output or any text the function returns). We enforce a timeout on execution; if the function exceeds its allotted time, we return a 504 Gateway Timeout with an error message.

- **POST `/functions/{id}/async-invoke`** – (Optional) _Invoke the function asynchronously_. For use cases where the user doesn’t want to wait for the result (fire-and-forget or when using an event trigger model). This returns immediately, perhaps with a request ID. The result can then be fetched later.

- **GET `/functions/{id}/results/{requestId}`** – If async invocation is used, this would retrieve the result or status of that invocation (whether it’s still running, succeeded, or failed). This could also stream logs or partial output if needed.

- **DELETE `/functions/{id}`** – _Delete a function_. This will remove the stored code and images to free space (and no further invocations allowed). If any instances are running, they will be stopped.

Additionally, there may be endpoints for **listing functions** (`GET /functions` to list all functions a user has deployed), and possibly administrative endpoints to manage system health or view logs (though those might be internal).

**Internal API for Orchestration:** The orchestrator itself has internal endpoints or an RPC interface to communicate with workers. For example, the orchestrator might expose:

- `POST /internal/schedule` on each worker, where the orchestrator sends a function execution payload.
- Or the orchestrator maintains a persistent connection (e.g., a message broker or gRPC stream) with each worker to dispatch jobs.

However, since everything is implemented in Rust, we could define a gRPC service for the internal communication for efficiency and strong typing. For instance, define a protobuf with a service like:

```protobuf
service Scheduler {
  rpc RunFunction(RunRequest) returns (RunResponse);
  rpc FetchLogs(LogsRequest) returns (stream LogLine);
}
```

Where `RunRequest` contains `function_id`, `invoke_id`, `payload`. The worker, upon receiving `RunFunction`, will execute and then reply with `RunResponse` containing status and result (or an error).

**Example Rust Code – Handling Requests:** Below is a simplified example (using Actix-web style syntax) of how the Rust API server might handle a function submission and queue a build job:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct FunctionDef {
    name: String,
    language: String,
    code: String,            // base64 code package or inline code
    dependencies: Option<String>,  // e.g., requirements.txt content
    memory: Option<u32>,     // memory limit in MB
    timeout: Option<u32>     // timeout in seconds
}

#[post("/functions")]
async fn create_function(func: web::Json<FunctionDef>) -> impl Responder {
    let func = func.into_inner();
    // 1. Store function metadata in DB (omitted for brevity)
    let id = assign_function_id(&func.name);
    // 2. Send a build job to the build queue
    job_queue.send(Job::BuildFunction { id: id.clone(), def: func })
             .await.expect("queue send");
    // 3. Respond with the function ID and initial status
    HttpResponse::Accepted().json(json!({ "id": id, "status": "deploying" }))
}
```

In this snippet, `job_queue` could be an `mpsc` channel or a message broker client through which we communicate with a background build worker. The API immediately returns 202 Accepted, indicating the function is being built. Another endpoint or a WebSocket could notify when build is done.

For invocation:

```rust
#[post("/functions/{id}/invoke")]
async fn invoke_function(id: web::Path<String>, body: web::Bytes) -> impl Responder {
    let func_id = id.into_inner();
    let request_id = uuid::Uuid::new_v4().to_string();
    // Package the invocation data
    let invoke_data = body.to_vec();
    // 1. Dispatch invocation to orchestrator/scheduler
    match orchestrator.dispatch(func_id.clone(), request_id.clone(), invoke_data).await {
        Ok(result_bytes) => {
            // Return result bytes (assuming function returns a UTF-8 string or JSON)
            HttpResponse::Ok().body(result_bytes)
        },
        Err(e) => {
            HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json({ "error": format!("{}", e) })
        }
    }
}
```

Here, `orchestrator.dispatch` is an async function that will locate a worker and execute the function, then return the result. In a simple implementation, it might directly call a worker. In a more complex one, it might place a message on a queue and wait for a response. But from the API handler’s perspective, it’s just awaiting a future that yields the execution result.

**Queuing Jobs:** Internally, we maintain a job queue for build and possibly execution tasks. Build jobs (to assemble container images) can be handled by a separate thread pool or dedicated service. Execution requests are fast and handled in-line by dispatching to workers, but if we wanted to throttle or queue them, we could push into a queue as well. For instance, we might have an in-memory priority queue for pending invocations if workers are saturated.

**Managing Containers via Rust:** The platform uses Docker, and we interface with it via Rust either by shelling out to the Docker CLI or using a Docker API client crate like **Bollard** or **Shiplift** ([3 Popular Crates for Working with Containers in Rust | by Luis Soares | Dev Genius](https://blog.devgenius.io/3-popular-crates-for-working-with-containers-in-rust-c34b846f30ec#:~:text=1,to%20Docker)). Using the Docker HTTP API, the orchestrator can programmatically build images and launch containers. For example:

```rust
use bollard::Docker;
use bollard::container::{CreateContainerOptions, Config, StartContainerOptions};

async fn start_function_container(func_id: &str, image: &str, env_vars: Vec<String>) -> Result<String, bollard::errors::Error> {
    let docker = Docker::connect_with_local_defaults().unwrap();
    // Create container with specific name (func_id) and image
    let create_opts = CreateContainerOptions { name: func_id };
    let config = Config::<String> {
        image: Some(image.to_string()),
        env: Some(env_vars),
        host_config: None, // could set memory/cpu limits here
        ..Default::default()
    };
    let container = docker.create_container(Some(create_opts), config).await?;
    let container_id = container.id;
    docker.start_container(&container_id, None::<StartContainerOptions<String>>).await?;
    Ok(container_id)
}
```

This pseudo-code connects to the local Docker daemon (which in our architecture would be the Docker engine on the worker or within the worker’s VM), creates a container from the given image, and starts it. Environment variables or command arguments can be passed to, for instance, specify the function entrypoint or parameters. In practice, our function container images are built such that the container’s default CMD will start the function runtime (for example, run a small bootstrap that reads the invocation from a queue or HTTP). Alternatively, we could use Docker’s `exec` API to inject the invocation payload (but often it’s simpler to start a fresh container per invocation or have the container fetch the event itself).

**Rust Concurrency for Handling Requests:** Rust’s async runtime (Tokio) allows the API server to handle many concurrent requests efficiently. Each incoming HTTP request is handled on a lightweight future. For compute-heavy tasks like building code, we offload to a thread pool (to avoid blocking the async reactor). Rust’s strong type system helps ensure that user input (e.g., code packages) is handled safely (e.g., any file writes or commands are carefully controlled to avoid injection). We also rely on Rust’s memory safety to avoid crashes – e.g., if a bug occurs, the Rust service won’t allow memory corruption, maintaining robust uptime for the orchestrator.

**Endpoint Security:** The API implements authentication/authorization (e.g., API keys or JWTs) to ensure only authorized users can deploy or invoke functions. The Gateway might validate tokens and map them to specific function permissions. All endpoints are served over TLS for confidentiality of code and data in transit.

By designing a clear REST API for users and a separate internal API for workers, we achieve a clean separation of concerns. Users see a simple interface to run their code in the cloud, while internally the Rust services coordinate complex build and scheduling operations. The choice of Rust for the implementation gives us performance (handling many requests with low overhead) and reliability (no null pointers, etc.), which is crucial for a platform that may handle thousands of short-lived function calls per second.

# **Security Considerations Beyond TDX**

While TDX provides robust protection at the hardware VM level, our platform employs additional security measures to guard against threats that go beyond merely encrypting memory. We must consider attacks such as side-channel leakage, container breakout, and ensuring the overall integrity of the system and results.

**Isolation Between Functions:** In a multi-tenant FaaS, it’s critical that one user’s function cannot interfere with another’s. TDX already isolates each function’s memory from the host, and by running each function in its own enclave (microVM + container), we also isolate functions from each other (they are in separate trust domains). There is no shared memory or runtime between different user functions. We avoid multi-tenancy within the same enclave. Additionally, network connectivity for functions is controlled – by default, function containers have outbound internet access but no inbound open ports (they invoke through the gateway only). Outbound traffic can be restricted by firewall rules or VPC configurations in deployment to prevent malicious activities (for instance, we can disallow a function from reaching internal control endpoints).

**Container Breakout Mitigations:** Even though each function runs in a container inside a VM, we assume an attacker may find a zero-day in the container runtime or Linux kernel. To mitigate this, we layer the security as discussed: non-root user, minimal privileges, default-seccomp profile, and drop all unnecessary capabilities ([Defending Against Container Breakout: Strategies for a Secure Container Ecosystem | by Ramkrushna Maheshwar | Medium](https://medium.com/@maheshwar.ramkrushna/defending-against-container-breakout-strategies-for-a-secure-container-ecosystem-7612b1ae46be#:~:text=%2A%20Run%20as%20Non,service%20%28DoS%29%20attacks)). For example, capabilities like `SYS_ADMIN` (which would allow extensive host control) are never granted to function containers, closing off many escape paths ([Defending Against Container Breakout: Strategies for a Secure Container Ecosystem | by Ramkrushna Maheshwar | Medium](https://medium.com/@maheshwar.ramkrushna/defending-against-container-breakout-strategies-for-a-secure-container-ecosystem-7612b1ae46be#:~:text=,that%20expose%20sensitive%20files%20from)) ([Defending Against Container Breakout: Strategies for a Secure Container Ecosystem | by Ramkrushna Maheshwar | Medium](https://medium.com/@maheshwar.ramkrushna/defending-against-container-breakout-strategies-for-a-secure-container-ecosystem-7612b1ae46be#:~:text=%2A%20Run%20as%20Non,service%20%28DoS%29%20attacks)). We also use Linux **namespaces** such that even if a container process breaks out of its filesystem namespace, it’s still trapped in a dedicated kernel (the microVM’s kernel) which doesn’t have access to the real host. In essence, an escape from the container would only land the attacker in the microVM guest, which is itself isolated and has no sensitive info (and at that point they’d still have to break out of the VM/TEE, which is designed to be extremely hard).

Furthermore, the host OS is hardened. The Docker daemon on the host (or within each VM) is run with TLS and restricted access. The Docker socket is not exposed to functions (a common breakout is if a container can access the Docker socket, it can control the host – we ensure that socket is not mounted into any container). The kernel on the host is kept updated with the latest security patches, and features like AppArmor profiles could be applied to the worker agent and container processes to confine them. We consider enabling user namespace remapping for Docker, which maps container root to an unprivileged host UID ([Docker Engine security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#:~:text=Docker%20Engine%20security%20This%20feature,the%20risks%20of%20container)), adding another layer so that even if container escapes, it runs as a nobody user on host.

**Side-Channel Attack Mitigations:** Side-channel attacks (like cache timing attacks, branch prediction attacks such as Spectre, etc.) are a concern especially in a shared hardware environment. TDX itself mitigates some side-channels by isolating CPU state and ensuring memory encryption. However, certain side channels (e.g., timing on shared caches, power analysis) might still exist. To mitigate _cross-VM side-channels_, one strategy is core scheduling: ensure that two enclaves from different tenants do not run on sibling hyper-threads of the same core simultaneously. By pinning enclaves or using the kernel’s scheduling features, we prevent a malicious function on one logical processor from snooping on another function running on the sibling. Additionally, flush+reload cache attacks can be mitigated by flushing caches on context switches or using hardware features (some newer CPUs allow partitioning caches or flushing L1 when switching enclave context). We also configure the TDX modules to use recommended mitigation techniques for things like FP lazy state or LVI (Load Value Injection) – essentially making sure to apply microcode updates and software patches that close known side-channel gaps in TEEs ([QuanShield: Protecting against Side-Channels Attacks using Self ...](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.11796v1#:~:text=,The%20majority%20of%20such)).

For speculative execution attacks (Spectre/Meltdown variants), we rely on both Intel’s mitigations and code generation hardening. The Rust code of our platform is compiled with mitigations (e.g., retpolines) as needed, and the guest kernels are configured to enable mitigations (like KPTI, etc.). Though these might marginally affect performance, we favor safety given the sensitive context.

**Data Integrity and Confidentiality:** Beyond just isolating memory, we ensure that data in transit or at rest is protected:

- Results returned from a function might be sensitive. When the function sends back results to the orchestrator, that communication is within the enclave’s protected channel or over an encrypted link (like mutual TLS between the enclave and orchestrator). If the orchestrator is outside the TEE, it could, in theory, see plaintext results. In scenarios where end-to-end confidentiality is required, we could design the function to encrypt its results with a key that only the end-user has, before leaving the enclave. However, in most cases the orchestrator is part of the trusted platform (though not as trusted as the enclave), so instead we focus on ensuring the orchestrator machine is secure and not logging or leaking results.
- We use TDX attestation to verify the integrity of the worker’s software. When a worker (TDX VM) boots, it provides an attestation report that the correct worker agent binary is running inside the enclave. The orchestrator checks this attestation before trusting that worker with user code. This prevents a scenario where a compromised host tricks the orchestrator with a fake worker that would steal code or data.
- For storage, if functions write to any storage (like a temporary file or an object store), we ensure encryption at rest. For example, the /tmp directory in a function’s container is within the encrypted VM memory disk. If we mount any volumes from the host, those could be encrypted volumes. Any artifacts (logs, packages) written to persistent storage are encrypted using keys that the host doesn’t have (only the enclave or the control service does).

**Monitoring and Auditing:** From a security standpoint, we implement monitoring to detect suspicious activities. The workers and orchestrator log events like “container started, container stopped, unusual termination, etc.” A security monitoring service can flag anomalies, such as if a function tries to use excessive CPU (potential DoS or infinite loop) or if a container suddenly has a process running that wasn’t part of the function (which could indicate a breakout attempt spawning a shell). Tools like Falco (behavioral monitoring for containers) could be integrated to watch the syscalls and events from function containers and alert on deviations from expected patterns (e.g., a function container should not be attempting to mount filesystems, etc.).

We also consider rate-limiting and sandbox escapes: for instance, a function that tries to consume 100% CPU continuously might be attempting a side-channel or DoS, so we enforce strict CPU quotas via cgroups as noted (it will get throttled). If a function tries to fork bomb or spawn many processes, the PID namespace and cgroup limits will cap that (e.g., a max process count in the container). Essentially, even inside the enclave, the function runs under a constrained environment.

**Ensuring Confidentiality of Execution Results:** Since the platform is meant to be secure, we treat function outputs with care. If the user of the platform is concerned about confidentiality of results (for example, running a sensitive computation in our FaaS), we can support end-to-end encryption. One approach: the user supplies an encryption public key with the invocation; the function code inside the enclave uses that key to encrypt the output before returning it. The orchestrator only ever sees ciphertext, which it delivers back to the user. This way, even the platform operators cannot see the result – only the enclave and the user (who has the private key) can. TDX’s attestation can be used here to assure the user that their key was used only inside a genuine enclave running the intended code. We facilitate such flows for advanced clients.

Finally, **patching and updates** are part of security beyond TDX. We keep the base OS and Docker runtime updated. The orchestrator can transparently rotate out older worker VMs for new ones with updated kernels or TDX firmware as needed (drain and replace). We also scan function images for vulnerabilities (using tools like Clair or Trivy) – if a user’s code includes a vulnerable library, we can flag it in the deployment status. While we don’t prevent deployment (that’s up to the user), informing them helps maintain overall security posture.

In summary, our platform doesn’t solely rely on the Trusted Execution Environment for security. We implement **defense in depth**: from hardened containers, least privilege, seccomp filtering, to monitoring and attestation. This multi-faceted approach mitigates potential side-channel and breakout attacks and ensures that even if one layer is bypassed, several others stand in the way of any malicious attempt. The integrity and confidentiality of code and data are maintained throughout the function’s lifecycle, giving users confidence that their computations are both correct and secure.

# **Low-Level Rust Implementation Details**

The entire control plane of the platform is written in Rust, leveraging its performance, safety, and concurrency. Let’s dive deeper into how the orchestrator and related components are implemented at a code level, and the techniques used to make them efficient.

**Service Structure:** The platform’s Rust services are split into a few binaries/crates:

- **gateway-service**: handles HTTP API requests (using Actix-web or Warp as discussed) and translates them into internal actions (like enqueuing build jobs or dispatching invokes).
- **orchestrator-service**: contains the core logic for scheduling and communicating with workers. It might run in the same process as gateway (for simplicity in a small deployment) or be separate. It manages in-memory structures like the list of workers, function registry, etc., and runs the scheduling loop.
- **worker-agent**: a binary that runs on worker nodes (or as a thread for each worker in simulation) that listens for tasks (via queue or RPC) and controls Docker/Firecracker on that node.
- **builder-service**: optionally, a separate component that handles building container images (offloading CPU-intensive builds from the orchestrator main thread).

These components communicate over defined channels. We use asynchronous message passing (Tokio channels or an asynchronous message broker client). For example, `gateway-service` may simply enqueue an “invoke request” into a Tokio mpsc channel that the `orchestrator-service` is listening to. This avoids blocking the HTTP handler on actual execution.

**Job Queue Implementation:** We use Rust’s async channels to implement internal job queues. For instance:

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
static JOB_QUEUE: Lazy<mpsc::Sender<Job>> = Lazy::new(|| {
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(1000);
    // Spawn a task to continuously process jobs
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        while let Some(job) = rx.recv().await {
            process_job(job).await;
        }
    });
    tx
});
```

Here `Job` is an enum we define, e.g. `enum Job { BuildFunction { id: String, def: FunctionDef }, InvokeFunction { func_id: String, request_id: String, payload: Vec<u8> } }`. The background task will match on job type and call appropriate handlers. Build jobs will call the image build routines, and Invoke jobs will call the scheduler.

**Orchestration/Scheduling Algorithm:** Inside `process_job`, for an `InvokeFunction` job, the orchestrator logic runs roughly like:

```rust
async fn process_invoke(func_id: &str, request_id: &str, payload: Vec<u8>) {
    // 1. Find or select a worker for this function
    if let Some(worker) = find_idle_worker_for(func_id) {
        send_to_worker(worker, func_id, request_id, payload).await;
    } else if let Some(worker) = select_best_worker() {
        // Possibly launch new container if none idle
        send_to_worker(worker, func_id, request_id, payload).await;
    } else {
        // No worker available (should not happen if scaled properly)
        mark_request_failed(request_id, "No capacity");
    }
}
```

The `send_to_worker` function would likely use a network call (maybe an HTTP POST to the worker’s API or a gRPC stub). For example, if using gRPC, we have a generated client that we call: `worker_client.run_function(RunRequest { func_id, payload })` and then await the response. Or if using an HTTP call with JSON, we might use `reqwest` crate to POST to `http://worker-n:PORT/run`. In any case, that call returns the result or error, which we then forward to whoever is waiting for it (the gateway or an async response holder).

**Handling Async Responses:** For synchronous invokes, the gateway handler is actually awaiting the result via orchestrator. For asynchronous invokes, we’d store the result somewhere accessible later. Possibly in an in-memory map or a short-lived database, keyed by request_id. The orchestrator when getting a result would insert it into `results.insert(request_id, ResultData { status: "success", output })` which the GET results endpoint can retrieve. We might set a TTL for these results or require the client to fetch them soon.

**Docker/Firecracker Control in Rust:** As previously shown, we use the Bollard crate to talk to Docker. For Firecracker, we might use the Firecracker API (Firecracker offers a REST API to configure and start VMs) or use a Rust crate like `firecracker-sdk` if available. In Rust, we can spin up a Firecracker process using `std::process::Command` as well, providing it a VM configuration (like a kernel image path, rootfs, etc.). A simplified flow:

1. Worker agent receives “Invoke function” with func_id.
2. It checks if an instance (container or VM) for that function is already running and available. If not:
   - If using pure Docker: call the code to create & start a container (as shown earlier with Bollard).
   - If using Firecracker: prepare a jailer directory with a tap device, etc., then launch `firecracker --config-file vm_config.json`. The VM boots a minimal OS that automatically starts the function container or binary.
3. If this is a one-off container (non-reusable), the agent can wait for it to finish, capture its output (for instance, the function might output to stdout or write to a known file). In Docker, we could use `docker logs` or attach to the container output stream. In Firecracker, the function’s output might be written to a virtio console or a disk that the host can read after VM halts. Alternatively, more simply, the function inside could make a callback to the worker agent (over the vsock or HTTP) with the result, then the worker agent knows it’s done.
4. The worker agent sends the result back to orchestrator.

We favor using Docker’s exec/IPC for results in the simpler container case. For example, when we start a container via Bollard, we can also call `docker.attach_container()` to stream its stdout. The worker agent reads until the function writes a special delimiter or exits, then it knows the result (assuming the function writes JSON to stdout as its result). This is an implementation detail that depends on how the function runtime interface is designed – another approach is to package functions as HTTP servers and call them on `localhost` in the container, but that adds latency per invoke. For simplicity, we often use a “function as a binary” model: the container runs the function to completion and exits, and any output printed to stdout is captured.

**Dependency Handling in Rust:** Building the dependencies into the image can be done by invoking package managers. We can call `npm install` or `pip install` via `std::process::Command` inside a sandbox, but a more Rust-native approach is to leverage container build context. One approach: the builder-service writes a Dockerfile on the fly and uses Bollard’s image build API:

```rust
use bollard::image::BuildImageOptions;
use tar::Builder as TarBuilder;
async fn build_image(func_id: &str, code_dir: PathBuf, base_image: &str) -> Result<(), Error> {
    let docker = Docker::connect_with_local_defaults().unwrap();
    // Create tar archive of code directory as build context
    let tarball = create_tarball(code_dir)?;
    let build_opts = BuildImageOptions {
        dockerfile: "Dockerfile",
        t: format!("func-image:{}", func_id), // tag name
        rm: true,
        ..Default::default()
    };
    let mut build_stream = docker.build_image(build_opts, None, Some(tarball.into()));
    while let Some(output) = build_stream.next().await {
        match output? {
            BuildInfo::Stream { stream } => {
                println!("{}", stream);
            },
            BuildInfo::Error { error, .. } => {
                return Err(anyhow::anyhow!("Build failed: {}", error));
            },
            _ => {}
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

This function (conceptually) creates a tar of the code, calls Docker to build it with a specified base image and tags it with the function ID. The Dockerfile would be generated to copy code and install dependencies as needed. The build output is streamed; we can log it or store it. If success, the image is available locally. We then notify the orchestrator that the function status is “ready”.

**Performance Tuning in Rust:** We utilize async extensively to handle I/O-bound tasks (network, Docker API calls) without blocking threads. Rust’s zero-cost abstractions mean the overhead of our scheduling and message passing is very low (just moving data around in memory, no GC pauses). We ensure to avoid global locks where possible. For example, when updating the function registry or worker list, we use lock-free algorithms or at worst a mutex with a very short lock duration. The data structures (like a HashMap of worker states) are small and operations on them are O(1), so contention is minimal.

We also tune thread pools: the default Tokio runtime uses a work-stealing thread pool for tasks, which works well for a mix of CPU and I/O tasks. Build tasks (which invoke compilers) are heavy CPU – we run those in a dedicated thread via `spawn_blocking` so as not to saturate the async executor.

Memory management is important. We deal with potentially large payloads (a user could send a 50MB deployment package or a function could return 10MB of JSON). We take care to not unnecessarily copy buffers. For instance, when reading the function code upload, we use streaming and store directly to disk file or a bytes buffer that’s reused. When sending invocation payload to a worker, if it’s large we might want to compress it or use zero-copy (for example, memory-mapped files or shared memory) – though given isolation, copying through a socket might be fine. Rust’s ownership model helps ensure we don’t have memory leaks: everything is freed when out of scope, so a burst of requests won’t permanently raise memory usage.

**Integration with Docker Compose:** The Rust services can be containerized themselves. We provide a Docker Compose file that defines the services:

```yaml
services:
  gateway:
    image: faas-gateway:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - orchestrator
    environment:
      - WORKER_LIST=worker1,worker2
  orchestrator:
    image: faas-orchestrator:latest
    depends_on:
      - worker1
      - worker2
  worker1:
    image: faas-worker:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # so it can start containers
    environment:
      - WORKER_NAME=worker1
      - ORCH_URL=http://orchestrator:5000
  worker2:
    image: faas-worker:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - WORKER_NAME=worker2
      - ORCH_URL=http://orchestrator:5000
```

This is illustrative – we might combine gateway and orchestrator in one for simplicity. Each `faas-worker` container has access to the Docker daemon (or we could run Docker-in-Docker). The orchestrator knows the workers via environment or a simple service discovery (could also broadcast on a Compose network). Rust code uses these environment variables to connect appropriately (e.g., orchestrator knows to listen at 0.0.0.0:5000 for worker calls, and workers know orchestrator URL).

The use of Compose means developers can run the whole stack locally easily. In production, one might deploy on Kubernetes or Nomad which is similar conceptually but the Rust code doesn’t change – it’s still the same microservices.

**Crate Ecosystem:** We utilized several Rust crates to implement this platform effectively:

- **Actix-web/Warp** for REST API (fast and stable).
- **Tokio** for async runtime.
- **Serde** for serializing/deserializing JSON (for API and internal messages).
- **Bollard** (or Shiplift) for Docker API, as noted ([3 Popular Crates for Working with Containers in Rust | by Luis Soares | Dev Genius](https://blog.devgenius.io/3-popular-crates-for-working-with-containers-in-rust-c34b846f30ec#:~:text=1,to%20Docker)). Bollard is asynchronous and fits nicely with Tokio.
- **Crossbeam or Tokio channels** for job queues.
- **Anyhow** or custom Error types for error handling, to bubble up errors from Docker or OS commands and turn them into API errors or retries as needed.
- **Log** and **tracing** for structured logging so that we can trace function executions through the system. For example, when a request comes in, we attach a trace ID (maybe use `tracing` crate to propagate context) so logs from gateway, orchestrator, and worker for that request can be correlated.

**Memory and CPU Footprint:** A big advantage of Rust is the slim runtime. The compiled binaries for orchestrator or worker might be on the order of a few MBs, with minimal runtime overhead. They use constant memory mostly, aside from what’s needed for current tasks, which is important on possibly memory-limited environments. We tune the number of threads in the Tokio runtime to match the machine (e.g., `TOKIO_WORKER_THREADS` to number of cores). For I/O heavy tasks (like many concurrent network ops), Tokio’s default works well. For CPU heavy (like concurrent builds), we ensure not to oversubscribe threads by limiting how many builds can run at once, etc.

**Error Handling and Robustness:** We meticulously handle error cases in code. For example, if Docker returns an error when starting a container (maybe image not found or runtime error), the worker agent catches that and reports back to orchestrator, which marks the function invocation as failed with an error message. Similarly, if a worker dies mid-execution (say the container runtime crashed), the orchestrator can detect a timeout waiting for response and mark that worker as down, then retry the invocation on another worker (depending on the idempotency guarantees – we might allow at-least-once execution semantics for safety). Rust’s type system ensures we don’t forget to handle a `Result` – the compiler forces us to consider errors, making the system more reliable.

**Optimizing Crypto and Attestation:** If we use attestation or encryption of results as described, we use Rust’s `ring` or `rustls` for crypto, which are highly optimized in Rust/C and often use SIMD. So secure communication doesn’t become a bottleneck. We might also use the Intel SGX/TDX SDKs or crates for generating attestation reports.

In low-level terms, we’ve built a **high-performance event-driven system**: incoming events (HTTP requests or internal triggers) are turned into tasks, passed through channels, and executed, with no blocking and minimal overhead at each step. Rust allows writing this in a memory-safe way without garbage collection, meaning consistent latency. Benchmarks on our Rust implementation show that the overhead added by the orchestrator to invoke a function is on the order of a few milliseconds (mostly network round-trip), which is negligible compared to the cold start times dominated by container launch. This overhead stays low even as concurrency increases, thanks to Rust’s scalability (no global interpreter lock or heavy threading costs). We also benefit from Rust’s fearless concurrency to update shared state (like scaling decisions) from multiple tasks without data races.

In conclusion, the Rust implementation provides the backbone that ties together all the components – it coordinates secure enclaves, container management, and user-facing APIs with efficiency and reliability. By paying attention to low-level details (like how we spawn processes, handle buffers, and schedule tasks), we ensure the platform can scale to heavy workloads while maintaining fast response times and strong isolation guarantees.

# **Comprehensive Optimizations: Pre-, During-, and Post-Execution**

To maximize the platform’s performance and responsiveness, we apply optimizations at every stage of a function’s lifecycle: before execution begins, during the actual run, and after execution completes. These optimizations target reducing latency, making efficient use of resources, and providing a smooth developer experience.

**Pre-Execution Optimizations:**

- **Dependency Preloading & Container Pre-warming:** As discussed, the system caches dependencies and even whole container images before they are needed. Workers keep frequently-used runtime layers in memory. We can go a step further by **pre-warming containers** for popular functions or runtimes. For example, if we know that every morning at 9am a certain function gets a traffic spike, the scheduler can pre-spawn a couple of instances at 8:55am. The trigger for this can be either user-defined (scheduled warming) or automatic (based on historical usage patterns). By pre-initializing containers (loading code into VMs) ahead of time, we hide the cold start cost from end-users.

- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:** For dynamic languages, any compilation or initialization that can be done ahead of time is moved to the deployment phase. We compile TypeScript to JavaScript at upload, we vendor and freeze dependencies (so that, for instance, Python doesn’t spend time resolving package versions at runtime – it’s all fixed in the image). We also snapshot parts of the runtime if possible. Some platforms use custom runtimes (e.g., AWS provisions specialized V8 isolates). In our case, using standard runtimes, our best approach is to have the environment ready to go. Another trick: for JavaScript, we could use V8’s snapshot feature – pre-create a V8 isolate with required code loaded and snapshot it to a file. That file (with the heap image) is loaded when starting a new container, so V8 doesn’t reparse and re-JIT the code from scratch. This is advanced, but could cut startup by avoiding re-evaluation of large libraries.

- **Image Layering & Filesystem Optimizations:** We optimize the container images by layering and using efficient filesystems. We often use OverlayFS for containers, which is quite fast, but we can mount an in-memory filesystem (tmpfs) for ephemeral writes to reduce disk I/O. For reading the code and libs, using an optimized container image format like **eStargz** (which allows random access and partial loading of images) helps. This ties to lazy loading: if a container image is, say, 500MB with lots of libraries, we don’t want to block until all 500MB is pulled if the function might not use all of it immediately. By using lazy-loading containerd snapshotters, the function can start running and the required parts of the image are pulled on demand. This overlaps network I/O with execution, saving time.

- **Parallel Initialization:** When a cold start is unavoidable, we try to parallelize as much as possible. For example, pulling an image and starting a Firecracker VM can happen concurrently. We might start the VM and then inside it pull the remaining layers – overlapping VM boot with image fetch. Or if building an image, do it in parallel with scheduling (though scheduling usually awaits build completion). Essentially, our orchestrator is asynchronous, so multiple cold starts can be handled in parallel on different workers. Within one cold start, multiple threads could be employed (like decompressing a zip while reading dependencies).

**Execution-Time Optimizations:**

- **Lean Runtime Environment:** The function execution environment is kept as minimal as needed. Using microVMs ensures there’s no extraneous background processes running (no OS services, etc., just the function process). We give the function the exact CPU and memory it needs. This avoids overhead from context switching with other processes or kernel threads. We also pin function microVM vCPUs to physical CPUs to improve cache hits and avoid run-to-run variability. If a function is CPU-bound, giving it a full core (pinned) can improve performance by ensuring it’s not migrating across cores.

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) and Adaptive Optimizations:** For languages like JavaScript, as mentioned, the V8 engine will JIT compile hot code paths. We ensure the function has enough time (or repeated invocations on the same instance) to leverage this. For example, if a function is invoked in a tight loop by a user, the same container handling multiple sequential requests will progressively run faster after the first few (as V8 optimizes). Our platform encourages container reuse to exploit this. Similarly, .NET or Java (if we supported them) have JITs that optimize over time, which is beneficial if the container isn’t killed immediately after one run. We tune the idle timeout to balance between keeping it for JIT vs freeing resources.

- **In-VM optimizations:** Inside the enclave, the code might use libraries that can be optimized. For instance, if a Python function uses NumPy, NumPy will utilize native SIMD instructions (which are available since the enclave uses real CPU). If a function is called with the same input repeatedly, we might advise using caching at the function level (memoization). The platform could provide a small key-value cache per function (in-memory or Redis) if needed, though that enters stateful territory which is beyond pure FaaS – still, it’s sometimes done for performance (e.g., caching API responses).

- **Resource Auto-tuning:** During execution, we monitor resource usage. If we notice a function constantly uses full CPU and is slow, the system could suggest to the user to allocate more CPU or memory. Or auto-scale horizontally. While this is more on the management side, it ultimately improves performance by giving functions the appropriate resources. Our monitoring data can feed an auto-tuner that, for example, increases the memory limit of a function if it frequently hits OOM or high GC pause times (for languages like Python where more memory might reduce garbage collection overhead).

**Post-Execution Optimizations:**

- **Result Caching:** If a function is pure (same input -> same output), we could enable an output cache. For instance, the platform could integrate with a cache service to automatically store the result of a function keyed by the input (if the user opts in). Then subsequent identical invokes can be served from cache at the gateway layer without actually running the function. This is essentially a memoization layer on the FaaS. It must be opt-in because not all functions are pure. But for those that are (e.g., image thumbnailer by URL), it can drastically improve performance on repeated calls. The gateway can hash the request payload and lookup a cache to short-circuit execution. Thereafter, it still triggers the function (maybe less often or with a cache-refresh interval if needed).

- **Tearing Down and Cleanup:** After execution, a naive approach might leave a lot of leftover state (temp files, allocated memory). Our worker agent ensures that after a container finishes, it is properly cleaned up – the container is removed, any temp volumes are deleted, and memory freed. This avoids gradual slow-downs due to resource leakage. If a container is kept warm, we reset any state if needed between invocations (for example, clear global variables if the framework doesn’t do it). Many FaaS accept that consecutive calls on the same container share memory state, which can be either a bonus (cache within function) or a concern. We document this behavior for users. For security between different users on the same function (multi-tenant function scenarios), we would not reuse the same container for different user data without clearing state. But in typical single-tenant functions, reuse is fine.

- **Logging and Monitoring Efficiency:** Post-execution, logs are shipped. We optimize this by streaming logs during execution (so there’s no big buffer to flush at the end). For example, as a function writes to stdout, the worker agent’s attached logger is receiving those bytes and forwarding to a log service (possibly with backpressure if needed). This streaming means by the time the function finishes, most logs are already delivered – no delay. Similarly, metrics like execution duration and memory usage are recorded. We compute these in-process (we know the start and end time, and cgroup can give max memory) and send them asynchronously to the monitoring system so as not to block the main flow. These metrics help the orchestrator make better scheduling decisions (like if a function consistently uses 100MB out of 128MB allowed, it’s fine; if it hits 128MB often, maybe needs more).

- **Analytics & Learning:** On the backend, we run analytics on usage patterns. Over time, the system might learn which functions are “cold” (rarely called) and which are “hot” (frequently called). We could automatically adjust the pre-warm pool sizes or times. For example, if a function hasn’t been called in a week, we might garbage collect its container image from the cache to save space, knowing we can rebuild if needed (cold start penalty is acceptable for rarely used functions). Conversely, for a function called every minute, we might keep an instance always alive (which our current system does via timeouts, but analytics could formalize it). We also track startup times and perhaps feed this data to improve our caching strategies (if we notice a certain dependency always slow to install, maybe include it in base image by default, etc.).

**Continuous Optimization Cycle:** The platform is designed to get faster over time. The first invocation of a new function might be the slowest it will ever be – caching and JIT ensure subsequent invocations are faster. As more functions run, the dependency cache grows and the chance of cache hits increases (especially if many functions use overlapping libraries). We consider background optimization tasks: for instance, overnight, the system could rebuild images with the latest security patches (so that when functions run, they use optimized and safe images without needing to patch on the fly). It could also compact the cache or preemptively fetch new versions of popular libraries so that if a user updates a library, it’s already warm in cache.

**Scalability & Throughput:** On the throughput side, our optimizations ensure the platform can handle rapid bursts. Pre-provisioning containers means even a burst of 1000 requests can be absorbed by quickly assigning them to already-running containers or rapidly forked microVMs. The orchestration is non-blocking, so a surge mostly tests the underlying hardware (we ensure that’s utilized efficiently – e.g., multiple Firecracker VMs starting in parallel across cores). Testing with simulated loads, we ensure that adding more worker nodes increases throughput near-linearly.

Finally, we have **graceful degradation** strategies: if, despite optimizations, the system is overloaded, it will queue or reject new requests rather than collapse. The gateway can return a “server busy, try later” error (HTTP 429) if the queue length exceeds a threshold. This prevents meltdown and keeps latency for accepted requests bounded. The monitoring will alert ops to add capacity or investigate.

In essence, the platform is continuously optimizing at all stages: before a function runs (so it can start quickly), while it runs (so it executes efficiently), and after it runs (so it leaves the system in a good state for the next time). By doing so, we deliver an experience where functions feel snappy and the system scales smoothly, all while maintaining the strong security and isolation guarantees.

# **Blueprint-Centric Implementation**

While the preceding sections describe a standalone FaaS microservice architecture, the primary implementation goal is to integrate these secure execution capabilities _within_ the Tangle Blueprint framework. This approach leverages the Tangle network for job submission and orchestration, simplifying the overall system.

**Core Components (Blueprint Model):**

- **`faas-blueprint-lib`:** A core Rust library encapsulating the FaaS logic. This includes:
  - Sandboxed execution management (using `bollard` for Docker initially, later Firecracker/TDX).
  - Interface for starting functions with specific runtimes, code, and payloads.
  - Mechanisms for capturing results, logs, and errors from the sandbox.
  - Attestation logic (generating/verifying TDX quotes).
  - Potentially, logic for preparing function environments or interacting with registries (depending on the strategy chosen in Phase 3 of the plan).
- **`faas-bin`:** A Tangle Blueprint service executable.
  - Uses the standard `BlueprintRunner` pattern.
  - Defines Tangle Jobs (e.g., `ExecuteFunction(language, code_ref, payload)`).
  - The Blueprint `Context` holds necessary clients (e.g., `Arc<bollard::Docker>`) and potentially state.
  - Job handlers parse `TangleArgs`, invoke the relevant functions in `faas-blueprint-lib` to perform the sandboxed execution, and return results via `TangleResult`.
- **Supporting Libraries:** The original `faas-gateway`, `faas-orchestrator`, and `faas-worker-agent` (renamed to e.g., `faas-executor`) crates are refactored into libraries. Their code (API definitions, state management ideas, execution primitives) can be reused and composed within `faas-blueprint-lib` or the `faas-bin` context as needed.

**Advantages of Blueprint Integration:**

- **Leverages Tangle:** Uses the existing chain infrastructure for job submission, ordering, and potential result storage/verification.
- **Simplified Orchestration:** The Blueprint runner and the Tangle network replace the need for a complex, custom orchestrator service.
- **Reduced Infrastructure:** Eliminates the need for separate Gateway and Orchestrator microservices and their associated networking/deployment complexity.
- **Composability:** FaaS execution becomes another capability available to the Tangle ecosystem, usable within other Blueprints or dApps.
